Astronomy is the scientific study of celestial objects and phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere. 
It includes the study of stars, planets, galaxies, and cosmic phenomena like supernovae explosions and black holes. 
Modern astronomy is divided into observational and theoretical branches. 
Observational astronomy focuses on acquiring data from observations, 
while theoretical astronomy uses computational models to explain these observations.
